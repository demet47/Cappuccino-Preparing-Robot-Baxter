# Cappuccino-Preparing-Robot-Baxter
Graduation Project


We will be tracking and enhancing the progress of the project via the [Wiki part](https://github.com/demet47/Cappuccino-Preparing-Robot-Baxter/wiki) of the repository.

- Running custom_visualize_in_pybullet.py:
  - the file is responsible for two tasks:
    - forming the joint representation of cartesian location data formed by running sample_data_formation.py.
    - if selected Y when prompt appears, demonstrates the trajectory you give as input from the second command line prompt.
  - there are multiple trajectories to choose from while demonstrating. some are generated via sample_data_formation.py and some not. the variety of samples can be enhanced in the future.
